But there are one more concern about small LLM models did not provide fast or accurate information. It provides fast like quick information but that information cannot be more accurate. But large model provide slow information but accurate and in depth information. Also there was a problem to convert speech from the text and also problem to convert text from the speech.

So, and try catch method using try catch method we can analyze this whole whole error.

Likewise I can remember in my college I was working on one project called Cancer Patient Data Analysis where I have limited data about cancer patients. So I was working on the chatbot regarding how we can treat better to cancer patients. In that project I faced several problems to gather such data. So what I did I specifically generate data in that case. But in the different case on different project where I was designing house price predictor in that particular project there was a limited data available. So what I did is I took the mean and generate some data. Also I tried to generate model on the available data and tried to gather more and more data about that particular data set and contribute in existing data set. Likewise I have done and overcome this challenge where the data was limited. So I have done and overcome this challenge where I was working on the data. So I have done and overcome this challenge where I was working on the data. So I have done and overcome this challenge where I was working on the data.
